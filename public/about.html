<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, my name is Subhadeep Kirtonia, and I'm passionate about web development. I
  recently graduated with a degree in MCA with a focus on Full-Stack
  Development. Throughout my education, I've gained proficiency in languages
  like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, databases (SQL), and frameworks like
  React.js. I'm particularly excited about explored various technologies and
  frameworks across the stack, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end,
  to Node.js, and databases like MongoDB for the back-end.

  I enjoy the challenge of understanding how different components of a web
  application interact and collaborating with teams to build robust and scalable
  solutions. During my studies, I've had the opportunity to work on projects
  such as Fitness Website that I developed using RAPID API this project enabled
  users to access a wide range of fitness-related data and resources. These
  experiences have honed my problem-solving skills and taught me to collaborate
  effectively within a team. I'm eager to continue learning and growing as a
  developer, and I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to
  innovative projects and tackle new challenges in the field of web development.
